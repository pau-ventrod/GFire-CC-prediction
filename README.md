# GFire-CC-prediction

This is part of a bigger project called GFire (https://github.com/GFire-UAB). The main goal of GFire is to predict how a forest fire will spread throughout time in order to help firefighters stop the fire.

This model needs to be fed with some parameters, such as humidity of the zone, canopy cover, fuel types, ... 
Our work consists on building Machine Learning models to predict some of the parameters using LiDAR (high resolution laser) data. 

We are currently working on Canopy Cover prediction. Canopy Cover is described as the percentage of the area that is covered with canopy if it is seen from the sky.
